#PayU Gateway

## Environments
* SANDBOX: https://secure.snd.payu.com
* PRODUCTION: https://secure.payu.com

## Implementation
For performance reasons, I suggest to separately handle access token and its refresh and caching from order process,
but for small scale operations its just fine to get access token on the fly.
